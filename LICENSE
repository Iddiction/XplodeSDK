(b) Iddiction reserves the right (but has no obligation) to review any Developer Application, and to block any Developer Application, limit any Developer Application’s interaction with Iddiction Xplode, or take other actions Iddiction deems appropriate in connection with any Developer Application, if Iddiction, in its sole discretion: (i) disapproves of the Developer Application, (ii) believes that the Developer or the Developer Application violates the Acceptable Application Policy or any other provision of this Agreement, (iii) believes that the Developer Application otherwise creates liability for us, our users, or any other person or is detrimental to the Iddiction Xplode experience.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be contrary to law, then such provision shall be construed as nearly as possible to reflect the intention of the parties, with the other provisions remaining in full force and effect. Any notice to Developer may be provided by email. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and any and all written or oral agreements previously existing between the parties are expressly canceled.
